                        ## Galileo
                The first of these books discussed experimental observations that
                supported the Copernican theory that the Earth and all other planets revolve
                about the sun and that the Earth is not the center of the universe. 

                The second
                book is concerned mainly with the resistance of materials to fracture and the
                motion of bodies. 

                Both of these books emphasize the importance of
                experiments in deriving physical laws as opposed to 

                a reliance on proverbial
                beliefs, authority, or purely theoretical reasoning.

                Selected passages from the second of these two books will be used
                here to demonstrate:

                 The importance of experimental verification.

                 How very simple experiments that do not require
                sophisticated instrumentation may be devised.

                 The power of inductive reasoning.

                 The importance of explaining experimental observations in
                fundamental terms.

                 The importance of dialog and group action in the solution of
                complex problems.

                 The skillful use of example.

                 That even the most famous people may be wrong on occasion.

                 The origin of several important physical concepts including
                those of inertia, buoyancy, surface tension of liquids, the
                density of air, and its resistance to motion (drag).

                 How understanding one physical phenomenon in
                fundamental terms often provides an explanation for other
                related ones, or even suggests new inventions.

                 To illustrate the value of simulation in the solution of
                engineering problems.

                 That in the approximate solution of engineering problems,
                relative values rather than absolute numerical values are
                often sufficient, more easily obtained, and in some cases,
                preferred.

                        ## Galileo
                It is important that an engineer understand that the solution of new
                problems rarely involves a direct path of reasoning as textbook explanations
                usually do. Instead, several false starts are often involved before a
                solution satisfying all requirements and constraints is obtained.
                Galileos book is written as a rambling dialog between a professor
                (Salviati representing Galileo) and two students (Sagredo, an A student,
                and Simplicio, a C student) over a four-day period. To say that the book
                rambles is an understatement, and a first reading is apt to be confusing
                when following the order in which the material is presented. Therefore,
                selected passages concerned with topics being discussed in more modern
                terms are suggested at appropriate points in this text. It is hoped that this
                will not only illustrate the working of a great mind, but also serve as an
                introduction to one of the great pieces of classical scientific literature.
                The first segment of the Galileo text to be considered is the first
                page (passage number 49) followed by the passages numbered 50 through
                67. It is suggested that these pages be read after considering the following
                discussion of their content.
                In passage 49, Galileo mentions visiting the arsenal at Venice and
                interacting with the artisans there involved in the design and construction
                of various instruments and machines. He considers this useful since many
                of them by experience have sound explanations for what they do. However,
                he finds that all their explanations are not true and warns against
                false ideas that are widely accepted (proverbial concepts).
                Galileos main objective is to explain the resistance to fracture that
                materials exhibit. He begins by discussing the role that geometrical size
                plays relative to strength, and concludes that two geometrically similar
                machines made from identical material will not be proportionately strong.

                        ## Galileo
                In support of this view, several examples are discussed:
                 The case of similar wooden rods of different size loaded as
                cantilevers
                 The paradox of a brittle column being eventually weaker
                with three point support than with two point support
                 The strength of two geometrically similar nails loaded as
                cantilevers 
                In each of these cases, loading is not in simple tension but involves
                bending. Fracture involves not only the applied load, but also its distance
                from the point of fracture (called a bending momentthe product of a force
                and the perpendicular distance from the force to a center of rotation). At this
                point in the dialog, Galileo does not distinguish between strength in simple
                tension and strength in bending. However, in the second day, he derives a
                number of relationships for the relative strengths of beams of different
                geometries loaded in bending. These will be considered in Ch. 4.
                Galileo next tackles the origin of the strength of different materials
                in simple tension. Fibrous materials, such as rope and wood, loaded
                parallel to the grain, are considered first. The question of how a long rope
                consisting of relatively short fibers can be so strong is considered next.
                The role that helical entwinement of individual fibers plays is qualitatively
                explained as is the mechanics of a capstan and that of a clever device for
                controlled descent of a person along a rope (Fig. 3 in Galileo).
                The breaking strength of other nonfibrous materials is next considered
                from two points of viewthe force associated with the vacuum generated
                when two surfaces are rapidly separated, and the possibility of some sort of
                adhesion existing between minute particles of the material. The role of a
                vacuum which accounts for the tensile strength of a column of water turns
                out to be negligible for a solid such as copper. Galileo anticipates the fact that
                solids consist of extremely small particles (now called atoms) that are held
                together by some sort of adhesive substance (now called atomic bonds). He
                further concludes that when a metal is raised to a high temperature, the
                adhesive substance is reversibly neutralized and the metal melts. These
                matters are discussed from a modern perspective in Ch. 5 of this book.
                In passage 60 of the Galileo text, Sagredo makes the following Yogi
                Berra-like observation. ...although in my opinion nothing occurs contrary
                to nature except the impossible, and that never occurs. However, a
                short time later he makes a more meaningful observation that establishment
                of a vacuum, as when two smooth flat plates separate, cannot be
                responsible for the resistance to fracture since generation of the vacuum
                follows separation by fracture (cause must precede effect).
                It is suggested that, at this point, passages 4967 of the Galileo text
                be read to gain an appreciation for the way in which a problem is tackled
                by Galileo and the many interesting discussions that, temporarily, intervene.
                Galileo, being unusually inquisitive, cannot resist exploring many
                side issues, but eventually returns to the main problem.

                        ## Galileo
                Beginning in passage 68, Galileo considers the nature of infinity and
                whether infinity can be subdivided. This consists mainly of some clever
                geometrical considerations designed to better understand the meaning of
                infinity and whether subdivision of a solid into extremely small particles
                is feasible. The end result appears to be that infinity is not a number, but an
                entirely different concept. It, therefore, cannot be treated like a number
                and subjected to arithmetical operations such as addition, subtraction,
                multiplication, division, or extraction of a root. It is suggested that the
                material from passages 68 to 85 of the Galileo text be merely scanned.
                Material discussed during the remainder of the first day will be covered in
                subsequent chapters of this book, mainly because important concepts of
                significance today are clearly identified, and, in many cases, verified by
                elegantly simple experiments.

                        ## Galileo
                It is important that an engineer understand that the solution of new
                problems rarely involves a direct path of reasoning as textbook explanations
                usually do. Instead, several false starts are often involved before a
                solution satisfying all requirements and constraints is obtained.
                Galileos book is written as a rambling dialog between a professor
                (Salviati representing Galileo) and two students (Sagredo, an A student,
                and Simplicio, a C student) over a four-day period. To say that the book
                rambles is an understatement, and a first reading is apt to be confusing
                when following the order in which the material is presented. Therefore,
                selected passages concerned with topics being discussed in more modern
                terms are suggested at appropriate points in this text. It is hoped that this
                will not only illustrate the working of a great mind, but also serve as an
                introduction to one of the great pieces of classical scientific literature.
                The first segment of the Galileo text to be considered is the first
                page (passage number 49) followed by the passages numbered 50 through
                67. It is suggested that these pages be read after considering the following
                discussion of their content.
                In passage 49, Galileo mentions visiting the arsenal at Venice and
                interacting with the artisans there involved in the design and construction
                of various instruments and machines. He considers this useful since many
                of them by experience have sound explanations for what they do. However,
                he finds that all their explanations are not true and warns against
                false ideas that are widely accepted (proverbial concepts).
                Galileos main objective is to explain the resistance to fracture that
                materials exhibit. He begins by discussing the role that geometrical size
                plays relative to strength, and concludes that two geometrically similar
                machines made from identical material will not be proportionately strong.
